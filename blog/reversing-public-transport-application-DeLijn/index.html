							<h1>Reversing Public Transport Application 'DeLijn'<span class="blogpost-date">24/03/2020</span></h1>
							<p>
							It's 7:30 am and you just got out of bed, rushing your way out of the house to catch the bus. You made it, you are now sitting on the bus and waiting for almost an hour to arrive at your destination. You keep staring at your phone, looking at the traffic app to see how long until your bus reaches its destination, but then something comes to mind, "could it be possible to manipulate the traffic application so I can get faster to work? or at least get a free ride?"
